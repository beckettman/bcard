oh shit this is important:

A frequency (with 50% duty cycle) waveform output in fast PWM mode can be
achieved by set- ting OC0A to toggle its logical level on each compare match
(COM0A1:0 = 1). The waveform generated will have a maximum frequency of
f = f /2 when OCR0A is set to zero (0x0000).  0A clk_I/OThis feature is
similar to the OC0A toggle in CTC mode, except the double buffer feature of
the Output Compare unit is enabled in the fast PWM mode.
